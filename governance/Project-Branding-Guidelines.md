# Project Branding Guidelines

One of the first steps any open source project takes is choosing a name, but this important step is often given too little consideration. As with other products and services, the names and logos of open source projects (including nonprofit projects) are the project's trademarks. A well-chosen mark can confer upon the project the exclusive right to use that mark under applicable trademark laws, as well as the right to exclude others from using the same or confusingly similar marks. Without taking care, however, it is easy to choose a mark that cannot be protected, or that may infringe upon another's rights.

This guide is intended to help FINOS projects select strong marks and limit the potential for conflicts. This guidance is not a substitute for legal advice. If you have questions about a name or logo you would like to use for your project, please contact FINOS at legal@finos.org.

## What is a Trademark?

According to the US Patent and Trademark Office:
> * A trademark is generally a word, phrase, symbol, or design, or a combination thereof, that identifies and distinguishes the source of the goods of one party from those of others. 
> * A service mark is the same as a trademark, except that it identifies and distinguishes the source of a service rather than goods.

A trademark protects the name or logo of a product or service. Trademarks exist as much to protect consumers as to protect their owners: they assure consumers that products associated with a mark come from the owner of that mark. Trademarks are different from copyrights, which protect original works of authorship, and patents, which protect inventions.

## Characteristics of a Strong Trademark

Because trademarks are intended to uniquely associate a product with its producer, a trademark must be **distinctive** to qualify for protection (and registration) under trademark laws. That is, the mark must be sufficiently different from other marks used in the same market or industry that it adequately distinguishes one product from another.

To ensure that a mark is distinctive, projects should **avoid**:
* **Generic** marks that employ words or designs commonly used to refer to a class of products generally. For example, "Software" as a name for computer software would be generic.
* **Descriptive** marks that merely describe the product. Descriptive marks are similar to generic marks, but include a broader category of marks. For example, "Fast Sort" for a data-sorting library is descriptive. Unlike generic marks, it is possible for descriptive marks to be registered, if through their use in commerce they come to take on "secondary meaning" in the minds of consumers (i.e. to become uniquely associated with the product in the relevant market) and therefore acquire distinctiveness. However, this result is not guaranteed and descriptive marks should therefore generally be avoided.

The **strongest** marks marks are those that do not directly describe the product. They are generally categorized (in order from strongest to weakest) as:
* **Fanciful** marks bearing no meaning except to designate the product. A common example is "XEROX" for copiers.
* **Arbitrary** marks may contain words with an independent meaning, but with no connection to the product. For example, "APPLE" for computers.
* **Suggestive** marks suggest qualities or characteristics of the product but do not directly describe them like a descriptive mark does. For example, "WIKIPEDIA" suggests a wiki website containing an encyclopedia, but in the form of a made-up portmanteau.

By selecting a name or logo that meets these criteria, projects are more likely to end up with a distinctive mark that can be protected from confusingly similar uses.

## Doing a Trademark Search

[TBD]

# Project Name

We encourage FINOS project to select project names that:

- Has a good chance to be trademarkable. Generally favor an abstract, proper name, which is now already in use. The FINOS team can help validate that during contribution.
- Does not include words which might imply an SLA or create a potential liability (e.g. supported, secure, fastest, etc.)
- Does not attempt to position a project as "the unique" solution for certain area of technology, especially if no wide support exists amongst FINOS Members and contributors
- Does not include other (proprietary or open source) project names (e.g. upstream), unless that's explicitly allowed by the project


# Project Logo
We encourage FINOS project to select project logos that:

- Do not include other project logos
- Remind too closely existing brands


# How does FINOS protect a project brand?
FINOS generally monitors usage of FINOS project brands and the FINOS brand itself for compliance with the [FINOS trademark guidelines](Trademark-Guidelines.pdf). 
Additionally if the FINOS team becomes aware of allegedd technical misrepresentations on a FINOS project in the public press, it will work with the Project maintainers to 
validate veracity of the statements and take actions as needed.

Please email legal@finos.org if you'd like to report misuse of FINOS projects brands.
