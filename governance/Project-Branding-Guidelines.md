# Project Branding Guidelines

Like for any proprietary software, choosing a good project brand is a fundamental exercise for an open source project, as it ensures longevity to the brand and generally speaking 
can reduce or avoid all together legal or contentious discussions on the Community.

A brand is typically made of a project name and a project logo, and we provide guidelines below based on the experience of the open source community of the years. 

# Project Name

We encourage FINOS project to select project names that:

- Has a good chance to be trademarkable. Generally favor an abstract, proper name, which is now already in use. The FINOS team can help validate that during contribution.
- Does not include words which might imply an SLA or create a potential liability (e.g. supported, secure, fastest, etc.)
- Does not attempt to position a project as "the unique" solution for certain area of technology, especially if no wide support exists amongst FINOS Members and contributors
- Does not include other (proprietary or open source) project names (e.g. upstream), unless that's explicitly allowed by the project


# Project Logo
We encourage FINOS project to select project logos that:

- Do not include other project logos
- Remind too closely existing brands


# How does FINOS protect a project brand?
FINOS generally monitors usage of FINOS project brands and the FINOS brand itself for compliance with the [FINOS trademark guidelines](Trademark-Guidelines.pdf). 
Additionally if the FINOS team becomes aware of allegedd technical misrepresentations on a FINOS project in the public press, it will work with the Project maintainers to 
validate veracity of the statements and take actions as needed.

Please email legal@finos.org if you'd like to report misuse of FINOS projects brands.
