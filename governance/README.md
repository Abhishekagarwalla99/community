# FINOS Governance

This space provides an overview of the Foundation's governance. 

## Foundation Governance

FINOS is a membership organization with three tiers of corporate membership (Platinum, Gold, and Silver), each with different rights and obligations under the Foundation's [Charter](Charter.pdf). The Foundation is overseen by a [Governing Board](https://finos.org/board-of-directors/) composed of member representative appointed (and elected) by our members. The Foundation's day-to-day operations are run by the FINOS staff, led by our Executive Director.

The following policies apply to all FINOS activities:

* The [Charter](Charter.pdf) is the Foundation's constitution. It sets out our mission, members' rights and responsibilities, the authority and procedures of our Governing Board and its committees, and other Foundation policies.

* The [Participation Agreement](Participation-Agreement.pdf) is the agreement that all of our members sign to join FINOS. It sets membership fees and terms and binds members to the terms of the [Charter](Charter.pdf). FINOS members must also be members of the Linux Foundation (at any level) and remain in compliance with LF's [Good Standing Policy](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/good-standing-policy).

* The [Community Code of Conduct](Code-of-Conduct.md) is the set of principles that participants in the Foundation's collaborative work are expected to abide by to maintain a healthy and inclusive community.

* The [IP Policy](IP-Policy.pdf) contains rules related to the intellectual property of FINOS, our members, and contributors. It includes policies for the licensing of contributions to FINOS projects, licensing of FINOS projects to third parties, and licensing of contributions to FINOS technical standards.

* The [Trademark Guidelines](Trademark-Guidelines.pdf) list the Foundation's trademarks and set out our policies for appropriate use of FINOS project marks.

* The Linux Foundation [Antitrust Policy](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/antitrust-policy) applies to all FINOS collaborative projects and prohibits all potentially anticompetive conduct.

## Project Governance

FINOS is home to two kinds of collaborative projects: open source software projects and open standards projects. The majority of FINOS projects are open source software projects. FINOS projects are self-governing and may determine their own governance rules consistent with FINOS policy, but FINOS provides default governance templates for both to provide projects with a starting point.

### Open Source Software Projects

#### Project Governance

The [default governance policy](CONTRIBUTING.template.md) for FINOS open source software projects follows a governance-by-contribution model. Project maintainers have the last word on technical matters, reaching decisions by consensus if possible and by vote if necessary. Anyone who has made a substantial contribution (of any kind) to the project may be nominated to become a maintainer.

#### Project Lifecycle

Software projects follow the [Project Lifecycle](Project-Lifecycle.md), starting out in the "Incubating" state and graduating to "Active" when they are able to demonstrate that they meet the Foundation's criteria for maturity, activity, and quality. Finally, projects may move to the "Archived" state from either Incubating or Active if they are no longer actively developed. The FINOS team approves all lifecycle transitions according to the detailed requirements for [Incubating](https://finosfoundation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FINOS/pages/75530363/Incubating#Incubating-IncubatingLifecycleChecklist) and [Active](https://finosfoundation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FINOS/pages/75530376/Activation#Activation-ActivationLifecycleChecklist) projects found in the [Community Handbook](https://finosfoundation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FINOS/pages/80642059/Community%2BHandbook) on the [FINOS wiki](https://finosfoundation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FINOS/overview). 

#### Contributor License Agreements

All contributors to FINOS projects must sign a contributor license agreement: the [Corporate Contributor License Agreement](CCLA.pdf) for corporate/institutional contributors and [Individual Contributor License Agreement](ICLA.pdf) for individual contributors whose contributions are not owned by their employer.

### Open Standards Projects

Technical standards projects are governed by detailed IP rules set out in the [FINOS IP Policy](IP-Policy.pdf). All participants in standards projects are bound by these rules, even if their only contribution is participation in project meetings. This is to ensure that any specification or other materials produced by a standards project may be licensed freely to all.

The default governance policy for FINOS standards projects can be found [here](CONTRIBUTING.standards.md).
