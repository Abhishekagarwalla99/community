# Special Interest Groups
Special Interest Groups provide a venue to discuss and compare notes on a common topic of interest. SIGs governance is documented [here](https://github.com/finos/community/tree/master/governance#special-interest-groups). 

Here's a list of special interest groups (SIGs) currently active in FINOS:

| Name  | Charter | Chair | URL  | Approved on  |

## Other potential SIGs

The FINOS Governing could be looking at converting into SIGs existing long running initiatives like:

- [Open Source Readiness Project](https://finosfoundation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OSR/pages/154435612/Open+Source+Readiness+Working+Group)
- [Open Developer Platform Project](https://github.com/finos/open-developer-platform/)
