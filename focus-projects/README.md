# What is a Focus Project

Every quarter the Board evaluates and selects 5/6 focus projects that are in formation, incubation or active stage. 

Focus projects get special attention, according to the [FINOS Project Support Guidelines](https://finosfoundation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FINOS/pages/1511161857/Project+Support+Guidelines) from the FINOS team during a specific quarter in order to achieve goals most often related to growing maturity, adoption and contribution and ultiamtely transition through the [Project Lifecycle](../governance/Project-Lifecycle.md).
